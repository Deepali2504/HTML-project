This HTML project is a team project.
Team members-
Sumona Biswas,
Aniket Anand,
Rohit Deswal.
We designed a restaurant's site using html and css learned during the time of our frontend course. The restaurant we decided to design the site for is Indian Accent. We designed the homepage, navigation bar, menus, gallery and other more pages such as contact details, booking seat for dinings and meals etc. for this whole project.
The work was divided within our team members and then all the pages were compiled later on. 
My part was designing the Famous Items of the restaurant, the Recipe and Ingredient Pages,and the Contact US page.My part is being uploaded in this html project repo.
